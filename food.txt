10 Eggs €3,50
Naturally Hardwood Smoked Bacon 500g €11,50
(Slab bacon is naturally hardwood smoked and perfect for a BLT. Not too salty or sweet, just great tasting old-time bacon.)
French Country Baguette €2,50
(Chewy, airy bread with a crisp, golden-brown crust. Our dedicated bakers spent countless hours working and reworking the recipe util it was absolutely perfect. Just bake briefly and this beautiful baguette will emerge from the oven warm and fragrant. Serve with slices of ham and provolone or enjoy with butter and preserves, or tear chunks straight off the loaf and dip into bowlfuls of garlicky mussel broth.)
