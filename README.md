# xt-Commerce-Parser
Product parser for xt:Commerce v3.0.4 SP2.1
Old script that was written for some client who needed to tranfer data to webshop(or to be exact to particular csv form that was supported by xt:Commerce). All info was stored in various text document. Maybe not totally perfect solution but worked well for those 5000+ items that he had.
parser.py - normal version
parsero.py - object version that was done later, but never used (i prefere functional programming for smaller tasks instead of full OOP)
